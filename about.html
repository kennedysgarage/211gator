					<p>Kennedy (right brained) & Brian (left brained) were neighbors that grew up together. When they were kids they did pretty much everything together, lifeguarding, fishing, and lots of surfing. When they graduated high school they went their own ways, but stayed in touch. They have always been there for each other when needed and at each others special events. Later in life they teamed up to build a company together. They both are very entrepreneurial that have complimentary skills and mindsets.</p>
