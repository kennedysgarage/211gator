					<p>Kennedy &amp; Brian were childhood friends. As kids they did pretty much everything together: lifeguarding, fishing, and lots of surfing. When they graduated from high school they went their own ways, but always stayed in touch. Sharing an entrepreneurial spirt with complementary skills and mindsets the two have now teamed up to build a company together.</p>
